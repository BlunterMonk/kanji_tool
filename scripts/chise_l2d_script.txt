Sensei, over here
Welcome, Sensei.
It's quiet here... Perfect for writing haiku.
Sensei, spending time with you was a lot of fun.
And that made me realize something.
I want to write a haiku...
About the feelings I had today.
...content with my lot...
...walking beside you all day...
It was really fun.
I think I can keep writing meaningful haiku...
...if I spend more time with you.
Let's hang out again, okay?
Oh... Sensei, look over there.
"Huh? Over there... you mean the moon?"
Isn't the moon beautiful?
"Hold on, Chise. Are you saying...?"
Yes! That was great, Sensei. 
"Some things are simply beautiful without using a fancy haiku to describe them..."

"Yeah, it's just like you said..."
"The moon is beautiful."
