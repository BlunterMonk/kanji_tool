Yo Sensei!
Let's play today!
No I mean, is it ok if I come to Schale, to train as a refined lady?
>Sorry Kaede, today I'm really busy with work...
Ehh... Sensei you're always working though
Sensei do you like work that much?
>I, wouldn't say that
Hmmm...? Ah, I feel like you said this before
Adults sometimes have to do things they don't want to do...
Yeah, being an adult is hard huh?
But looking at you Sensei, it doesn't seem like "sometimes"
>Guh, I can't say anything!
Well anyways...
Oh, I came up with a good idea!
>Good Idea?
Wait for me, Sensei!
Today I'm in "seriously help Sensei" mode!
See you later!
