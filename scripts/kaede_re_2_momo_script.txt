Sensei, today I'll continue to do my best to be a "refined lady"!
>Yeah, you're always doing your best
But the road to be a refined lady is pretty tough...
How difficult is it?
It's as difficult as getting a stamp every day on your "Radio Exercise Card" during summer vacation!
>Now that's hard!
Yeah so, I was wondering what I should do...
I came up with something amazing!
You could even call it, "the greatest discovery of the century"!
Come to the club room, I'll tell you about it!
