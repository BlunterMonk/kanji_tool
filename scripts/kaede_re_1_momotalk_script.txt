Sensei! Again!!
>Again?
Again, I heard someone say "The Etiquette Training club is kind of strange"! 
>That's kinda rude
Right?! Sensei you think so too?
I was just practicing my key lines in the park!
>Key lines...?
What's so weird about my lines?
Oh, of course it's the lines we at the Etiquette Training Club say when defeating problem children!
I'm practicing hard so that when the time comes, I can say it in a cool way
By the way, my line is "Autumn Leaves instead of Assault"!
Because you're special Sensei, you can use it ok?
Also the pose~! Oh, I should take a video, wait a moment
>Th-that's alright. You have my support anyway
Yay, thank you~ Sensei!
Sensei, I'll give you this cute stamp as a present!
>Ah, thank you
Anyway, I have to do something to avoid being called "weird" any more.
That's why Sensei, I have a request!
