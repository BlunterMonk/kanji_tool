Hey Sensei, is that thing at Schale?
>That thing....?
"Kamaboko Toushuden" Vol. 19!
We don't have it in the club room, so I thought maybe at Schale
>When did you get a clubroom...
Well it's, y'know, just a temporary room but... You never know when the Hundred Flowers Rampage might come crashing in...
And the Yin-Yang club, you never know when they might show up...
So my Ninja brain did the math.
And I thought that it would be a good idea to store the Ninja merch at Schale! 
>Schale is not a warehouse, Michiru...
Of course Sensei-dono should read it too, the "Kamoboko" series is really interesting!
Ah, by the way, let's meet at the park tonight
I'll be waiting for, Sensei-dono! 
>The convo moves too fast! /> That's no problem but, what are you doing tonight?
(Shu-ba-ba-ba-ba!!!) ← the sound of tying shoelaces
>That's a Ninja move too...!?
